<br />
Mission One for Level 5 Advanced Software Developer</div>

<h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT:</h3>

-->I struggled a lot with this Mission despite watching and reading all required and relevant recommended resources. I especially struggled with comprehending testing and the TDD environment and implementation.

-->But, as per all Missions at Mission Ready HQ, I learned a lot as well.

-->This is the first Mission where I haven't completed all of the tasks provided, but I will be meeting the Trainer (Andrew) one-one within the next few days for help to complete all tasks (remaining tasks are completing functional and passing tests, and editing the API to look more professional)

---

<h3>BUILT WITH:</h3>

1. JavaScript (Vanilla)
   <br />-->I was considering using TypeScript, but after our TDD session, it seemed like you can show a larger array of errors in your testing with JS
   <br />-->I was tossing up, but considering that I struggled a lot with this mission, it was probably just as well

2. Node JS

3. (the help of) Postman

<h3>DEPENDENCIES:</h3>

1. Express JS
2. Mocha (npm test)
3. Chai
4. Nodemon (npm run dev)
