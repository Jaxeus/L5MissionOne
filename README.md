# L5MissionOne

Mission One for Level 5 Advanced Software Developer

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

-->I struggled a lot with this Mission, especially comprehending testing and the TDD environment.

-->But, as per all Missions at Mission Ready HQ, I learned a lot as well.

-->This is the first Mission where I haven't completed all of the tasks provided, but I will be meeting the Trainer (Andrew) one-one within the next few days for help to complete all tasks (remaining tasks are completing functional and passing tests, and editing the API to look more professional)

BUILT WITH:
1. JavaScript (Vanilla)
*I was considering using TypeScript, but after our TDD session, it seemed like you can show a larger array of errors in your testing with JS
*I was tossing up, but considering that I struggled a lot with this mission, it was probably just as well
2. Node JS
3. (the help of) Postman

DEPENDENCIES:

1. Express JS
2. Mocha (npm test)
3. Chai
4. Nodemon (npm run dev)
