Mission One (and Three) for Level 5 Advanced Software Developer</div>
<br />
<p>**Readme info for Mission 3 is at the end of this file</p>
<br />

<h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT:</h3>

-->I struggled a lot with this Mission despite watching and reading all required and relevant recommended resources. I especially struggled with comprehending testing and the TDD environment and implementation.

-->But, as per all Missions at Mission Ready HQ, I learned a lot as well.

-->This is the first Mission where I haven't completed all of the tasks provided, but I will be meeting the Trainer (Andrew) one-one within the next few days for help to complete all tasks (remaining tasks are completing functional and passing tests, and editing the API to look more professional)

---

<h3>BUILT WITH:</h3>

1. JavaScript (Vanilla)
   <br />-->I was considering using TypeScript, but after our TDD session, it seemed like you can show a larger array of errors in your testing with JS
   <br />-->I was tossing up, but considering that I struggled a lot with this mission, it was probably just as well

2. Node JS

3. (the help of) Postman

4. HOSTED ON: Azure (For Mission 3)

<h3>DEPENDENCIES:</h3>

1. Express JS
2. Mocha (npm test)
3. Chai
4. Nodemon (npm run dev)

<h3>GETTING STARTED:</h3>

1. Create Folder in VS Code (e.g. L5MissionOne)
2. Open Integrated Terminal from that folder
3. In terminal: git clone https://github.com/Jaxeus/L5MissionOne.git
4. In terminal: npm install (to install node_modules)
5. In terminal: npm run dev (to run nodemon server.js) OR node server.js

What I did in Mission Three:

1. My mission one was not complete, so for starters I figured out how to get my API working locally, and managed to get the tests all working.
2. Next, I deployed my Mission One repo onto Azure as a web app
3. I created an index.html file and a style.css file to create a reasonable UI
4. I tested my API, but I have been unable to get it working using Postman. However, it works perfectly fine using a post request on Postman if I use the same API locally.
5. The only step I need to take to finish Mission 3 is to get it working, but I've spent a lot of time on it and have tried countless different options but it hasn't worked.
6. To be completed at this stage
7. Visit my deployed web app @ http://mission-one-three.azurewebsites.net/
